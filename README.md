**REPORTING BUGS OR SUGGESTIONS**

Reporting bugs will be done through Github. 

First create a github account: https://github.com/join

For this project, please create a github username of **gsrp-{your GSRP Name}**

Once you have created an account, visit our project: https://github.com/gsrp-sheldon/GSRP-CAD-Testing/issues

For any Bugs or Suggestions, please first ensure someone else has not reported the bug. A simple search for some keywords should suffice. If the bug or suggestion you have is not already submitted create a new issue.
